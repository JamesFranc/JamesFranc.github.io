 Yeah! \\

 Did this thing. \\

<!--excerpt-->

Blogging or journaling, don't you dare call it a dairy! #dougFunnyThings, has never really been something I've kept up with.
That being said, I wanted to start a repository of tips, tricks, cheat-codes and the like when it comes to web development.

This site has been a bit of a process for me. Having used AWS in the past for other projects, so naturally using Digital Ocean was the next logical step. Honestly, Digital Ocean's droplet interface a bit more straightforward than AWS's EC2 interface. That being said EC2 is geared more towards enterprise class software, so that's something to keep in mind.

In the coming weeks/months there will be updates on how this site, both the portfolio portion and the blog portion were constructed and designed. Like the portfolio says this was all done with the intent of building my understanding of web fundamentals, the only external resources being used are Font Awesome's super cool font icon library and a Google Font import. Sure, the forever alpha Boostrap4 probably would have worked, as would Skeleton (a really cool lightweight css framework), but I needed the practice and building this all from -index.html- was a task that needed to be done. As a CS major I didn't really focus on UI/UX (here's looking at you Unix/Mac terminal) so this was an endeavor that seemed necessary for my foundational knowledge.

The portfolio page in particular was aimed at using primarily HTML, CSS, with minimal JS and little to no reliance on external libraries. For page load speed, low resource utilization, and just straight simplicity's sake.

Here's a quick rundown of the project:


## Infrastructure:


### Digital Ocean Droplet:

                - OS: Ubuntu 16.04
         - WebServer: Nginx
          - Database: MySQL
      - Preprocessor: PHP


### Front End:

    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Javascript
    - Font Awesome
    - Google Fonts


### Additional Resources:

    - Google's PageSpeed insights - seriously a great tool for web development
    - A whiteboard


### Also got by with a little help from:
    - Lucy
    - Sam

We'll go a bit more in depth with future posts looking at standing the infrastructure up and configuration of Nginx to steps taken to achieve the mobile first responsive nature of the portfolio site.
