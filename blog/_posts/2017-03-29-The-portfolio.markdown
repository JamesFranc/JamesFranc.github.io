 Where do we begin?   

<!--excerpt-->

A personal website was something I had started to build in college but given my focus on job hunting, side projects,
and other obligations it fell to the wayside. After working at Healthtrust Software for almost a year, building some web applications for CMM Global, and senior project centered around relational databases, all while in school, I felt that I had enough time and experience to build my own portfolio from scratch. Back then I had used PHP, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Skeleton, HTML and CSS to make projects happen. My previous experience in web application development had centered around the LAMP, or LEMP, stack and I wanted to expose myself to something different.

Enter the MEAN stack. Nonrelational databses, that sounds neat! Javascript for the entire back-end and front-end... yes please. At one point I was even messing with Yeoman for rapid scaffolding a MEAN app, before even knowing that much about Node. I had cobbled together something that was passable but not really indicative of the work I was capable of. It felt bloated and I didn't really understand what was going on underneath the hood.

The site was never published because life got in the way.

Fast foward to 8 months later. I got the itch again but I also wanted to do something a bit more straight forward. I wanted to build a site from nothing no templates and no frameworks, that was responsive, mobile friendly, and adhered to web best-practices.

What did I want the site to do? How do I use color appropriately? What do I want people to learn about me?

I knew that I wanted a place to host my projects, a place where people could visit to learn about me and my past projects that was maybe a little more user friendly than my git profile.

Some... ok a lot of googling was done and other developer's profiles were looked through. I needed some ideas. Then, there was some whiteboarding done, not much, just enough to help feel and see the site. I loaded up Atom and got to work.
